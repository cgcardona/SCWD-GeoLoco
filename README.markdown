SCWD GeoLoco
============

Purpose
-------

This app was created for the Oct. 9th Santa Cruz Web Developers Group meetup. It
is built entirely with HTML5/CSS3/jQuery.

How to Use
----------

Visit [this website](http://spotbright.org) with any browser that supports HTML5 geolocation and you
will be prompted to allow the browser to get your location. If you click yes the
browser will grab your long and lat and display it on the screen. It will also
store the geo-coordinates using HTML5 localStorage.

Each time the user returns to the site they will be get their long and lat added
to the db and they will see a list of all the places they have previously
visited the website.

Caveat (or some other fancy word)
---------------------------------

Because I am developing this app for a live talk I am seeing how fast I can code
it from scratch. That is why there is the same code in so many different files
and branches. 

I am also taking this time to learn a bit more about git. I plan to clean up all
these branches and files before my talk.....or not.
