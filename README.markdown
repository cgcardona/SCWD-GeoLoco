SCWD GeoLoco
============

Purpose
-------

This app was created for the Oct. 9th Santa Cruz Web Developers Group meetup. It
is built entirely with HTML5/CSS3/jQuery.

The goal was to demo how easy it is to build an HTML5/CSS3/jQuery webapp that
tracks your geo-location and shows all the places you have checked-in in under 30 minutes and 100 lines of code. 

How to Use
----------

Visit [this website](http://bitnirvana.com/scwd/geoloco) with any browser that supports HTML5 geolocation and you will be prompted to allow the browser to get your location. If you click yes the
browser will grab your long and lat and display it on the screen. It will also
store the geo-coordinates using HTML5 localStorage.

Each time the user returns to the site they will be get their long and lat added
to the db and they will see a list of all the places they have previously
visited the website.
